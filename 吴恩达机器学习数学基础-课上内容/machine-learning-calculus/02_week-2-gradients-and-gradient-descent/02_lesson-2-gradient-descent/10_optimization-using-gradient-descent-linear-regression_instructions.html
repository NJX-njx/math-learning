  In this assignment, you will build a simple linear regression model to predict sales based on TV marketing expenses. You will investigate three different approaches to this problem. You will use
  <var>
   NumPy
  </var>
  and
  <var>
   Scikit-Learn
  </var>
  linear regression models, as well as construct and optimize the sum of squares cost function with gradient descent from scratch.

    IMPORTANT NOTE FOR GRADING:
   </strong>
  </u>
 </p>
 <p>
  Please submit your work after placing your solutions in the exercises of the assignment and
  <strong>
   saving
  </strong>
  the notebook.
  <strong>
   Donâ€™t delete cells
  </strong>
  as these include important metadata for grading.  Fill out your solutions within the provided spaces (i.e. replacing the
  <var>
   None
  </var>
  placeholders). You can add new cells but these will be omitted by the grader.
 </p>
 <p>
  Remember that
  <strong>
   you can submit your work even if you are not done with the whole assignment by using the partial grading feature
  </strong>
  explained in the previous reading item.
 </p>
 <p>
  To use this feature include the comment
  <var>
   # grade-up-to-here
  </var>
  in the
  <strong>
   last cell that you wish to be evaluated
  </strong>
  and subsequent cells will be omitted from the grading process.
  <u>
   This way you can know if you are on the right track before finishing the whole assignment.
  </u>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   When resuming, remember to delete the comment
  </strong>
  since the grader automatically filters out all of the cells after the first time it encounters it.
