  Which of the following statements best describes the law of large numbers?
 </p>
</co-content>
<form>
 <label>
  <input name="1" type="radio"/>
  <co-content>
   <span>

 <label>
  <input name="1" type="radio"/>
  <co-content>
   <span>
    The law of large numbers states that as the sample size increases, the sample mean approaches the population mean with increasing accuracy.

 </p>
</co-content>
<form>
 <label>
  <input name="2" type="radio"/>

 </label>
 <label>
  <input name="2" type="radio"/>
  <co-content>
   <span>
    The central limit theorem states that as the sample size increases, the sampling distribution of the mean approaches a normal distribution, regardless of the distribution of the population.
