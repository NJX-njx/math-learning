 <p>
  All your answers are saved in a file named answers.json. The saving is handled within the notebook so you don't need to edit this file yourself. When submitting your assignment, if you receive an error  message that says something about "malformed solution" you can use the function
 </p>
 <pre language="python">utils.reset_answers()</pre>
 <p>
  to reset your answers.json file (you will need to save all your answers again).
