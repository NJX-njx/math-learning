  5.  A factory produces two types of products: Type A and Type B. It is known that 70% of the total products are Type A, while the remaining 30% are Type B. The factory has a quality control system that can correctly identify Type A products with a probability of 80% and Type B products with a probability of 90%.

  If a randomly selected product is tested and found to be of high quality, what is the probability that it is Type A? (
