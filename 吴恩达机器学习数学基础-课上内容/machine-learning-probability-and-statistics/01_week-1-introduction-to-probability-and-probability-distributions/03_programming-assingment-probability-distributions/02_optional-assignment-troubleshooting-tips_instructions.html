  Here are some general guidelines before submitting your assignments in this course. Please keep this in mind not only for this week's assignment but for the next ones as well:
 </p>
 <p>
  1. Make sure to save your work before clicking the
  <var>
   Submit
  </var>
  button. If not, you might get an error message. Remember that everything that you need to fill in within the graded functions is initialized to
  <var>
   None
  </var>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  2. Please do not rename the notebook. The grader will look for the original filename and its associated metadata so you should work on the file that is automatically opened when you click the
  <var>
   Open Assignment
  </var>
  button. If you try to submit a renamed notebook, then you might also get an error like the one shown above.
 </p>
 <p>
  3. Please do not modify any code outside the
  <var>
   START CODE HERE
  </var>
  and
  <var>
   END CODE HERE
  </var>
  tags. Your solution should only be placed between these markers to ensure successful grading. Modifying function parameters and other test cells will likely break the grader. If you want to experiment with these, you can do so after you have successfully passed the assignment.
 </p>
 <p>
  4. After following the tips above and the grader still gives you 0/100, it's possible that the metadata needed for grading is corrupted. Please get a new lab notebook by refreshing your workspace (

   instructions here
  </a>
  ). Then copy your solutions into the new notebook. Make sure that all cells still run as expected then resubmit.
 </p>
 <p>
  5. If you have further questions, please create a topic in the Discourse community instead of the Coursera discussion forums. You can join by
  <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-probability-and-statistics/ungradedLti/8E0LH/important-have-questions-issues-or-ideas-join-our-community" title="">
   following the instructions here
  </a>
  . You will get help there quicker because several mentors and your fellow learners are monitoring the posts. Just make sure to create the topic in the correct course category.
