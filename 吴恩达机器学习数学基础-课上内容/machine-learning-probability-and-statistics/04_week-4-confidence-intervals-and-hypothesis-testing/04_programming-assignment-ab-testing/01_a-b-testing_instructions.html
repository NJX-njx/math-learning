   <strong>
    IMPORTANT NOTE FOR GRADING:
   </strong>
  </u>
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  Please submit your work after placing your solutions in the exercises of the assignment and
  <strong>
   saving
  </strong>
  the notebook.
  <strong>
   Donâ€™t delete cells
  </strong>
  as these include important metadata for grading.  Fill out your solutions within the provided spaces (i.e. replacing the None placeholders). You can add new cells but these will be omitted by the grader.
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  Remember that
  <strong>
   you can submit your work even if you are not done with the whole assignment by using the partial grading feature
  </strong>
  explained in the previous reading item.
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  To use this feature include the comment # grade-up-to-here in the
  <strong>
   last cell that you wish to be evaluated
  </strong>
  and subsequent cells will be omitted from the grading process.
  <u>
   This way you can know if you are on the right track before finishing the whole assignment.
  </u>
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  <strong>
   When resuming, remember to delete the comment
  </strong>
  since the grader automatically filters out all of the cells after the first time it encounters it.
